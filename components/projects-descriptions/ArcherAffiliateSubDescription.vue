  <p>The extension allows users to interact with a form on Amazon product pages, helping them create affiliate links directly from the product page. I also developed the extensionâ€™s popup, where users can log in and access the same React features found on the product page.</p>

    For this project, I used <a
      href="https://docs.plasmo.com/"
      target="_blank"
      class="font-bold hover:underline"
    >Plasmo</a>, a great framework that makes building Chrome extensions easier, similar to <a
      href="https://nextjs.org/docs"
      target="_blank"
      class="font-bold hover:underline"
    >Next.js</a>, but designed for browser extensions.
